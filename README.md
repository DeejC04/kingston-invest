## API Key
### For this project, I use the Alpha Vantage API. They currently offer free API keys. Head over [here](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key) to claim your free key.
Once you have your API key, create a file called `.env` inside the project's root directory.
Paste your API Key like this: `AV_API_KEY = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"`
Done!

# Running the project
### After everything has been installed and set up, type `.\update.bat` to run the project. This script will generate all data + images, then set the collage as your wallpaper.
